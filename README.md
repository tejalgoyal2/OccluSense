# Occluded-Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
Autonomous vehicles are the future of transportation, but safety and full autonomy are still evolving. Our study focuses on occluded object detection to enhance AV perception. We trained the YOLOv5 model using transfer learning, utilizing pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset, on a new dataset from Bangladesh.
